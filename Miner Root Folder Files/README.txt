**Directions**

MultiMiner is designed to get you mining as quickly and painlessly as possible.  To begin mining, follow the steps below.
	- Launch MultiMiner
	- Click the Wallets Tab and select the wallet of the coin/token you would like to mine
		- If you already have a wallet you would like to use, this step can get skipped
	- Once the wallet is open and running, take note of the Receive Address, this is the address we will be mining to
	- Click the Coins Tab and select the coin/token you wish to mine
	- MultiMiner will open a wizard to help you determine which pool you would like to mine on as well as a port to use 	  based on your hardware
		- Note: recommended pools are marked in GREEN
	- Enter the wallet address you noted in step 3 and enter a password for the mining pool
		- This can be anything you would like, typical passwords are usually x
	- Click Begin

That's it, you are now mining.  Congrats!
